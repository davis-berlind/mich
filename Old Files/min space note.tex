This is a common assumption in the CPD literature (see e.g. \citealp{Csörgö97, Bai10}), and has appeared in other Bayesian approaches to CPD (\citealp{Cappello21, Cappello22}); however, it is notably stronger than other minimum spacing conditions in the literature, e.g. \cite{Wang2020_localization} show that if the minimum spacing condition is known and is of order $\log^{1+\varepsilon} T$ for some $\varepsilon > 0$, then both their $\ell_0$-penalty and WBS methods remain consistent.
