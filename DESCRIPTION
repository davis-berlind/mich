Description: Implementation of the MICH model from Berlind, Cappello, and Madrid Padilla (2025). MICH provides Variational Bayesian inference for change-point detection problems. MICH can estimate the locations of mean and variance change-points and provide uncertainty quantification in the form of alpha-level credible sets around each identified change-point.
