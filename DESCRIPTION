Description: Implementation of Berlind, Cappello, and Madrid Padilla (2025). Variational
    Bayesian inference for change-point detection problems. Our main algorithm, MICH, estimates
    change-points and provides uncertainty quantification by returning alpha-level credible sets
    around each identified change-point.
