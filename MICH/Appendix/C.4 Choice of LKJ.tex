\subsection{Choice of $L$, $K$, and $J$}
\label{app:LKJ-choice}

As in Section \ref{sec:LKJ}, assume that $L^*, K^*, J^* \geq 0$ are the true numbers of mean-only, variance-only, and joint mean and variance changes in $\mathbf{y}_{1:T}$. In the standard case where we only consider a single class of change-points, e.g. when $J^* > 0$ and $L^*=K^*=0$, we automatically select $J$ by starting from the null model with $J=0$. We then increment $J$ until the ELBO stops increasing. For finite samples, the ELBO does not necessarily increase monotonically on $[J^*]$, so we continue the search for an additional $\log T$ steps after local maximum is found. To increase the speed of the search, we can use the fitted parameters from the $J-1$ component model to initialize Algorithm \ref{alg:mich} after incrementing $J$. To search over $L$, $K$, and $J$ simultaneously, we individually increment $L$, $K$, and $J$ and pick the direction that leads to the largest increase in $\text{ELBO}(q\:;\lambda_0, \mu_0)$.
