\subsection{Proof of Corollary \ref{cor:cred-sets}}
\label{app:cor-cred-sets}

\begin{proof}
In the proofs of Theorems \ref{theorem:smcp}, \ref{theorem:sscp}, and \ref{theorem:smscp}, we show that given the true change $t_0\in[T]$ and the posterior change-point probabilities $\overline{\boldsymbol{\pi}}_{1:T}$, we can pick $\kappa > 0$ large enough when defining the localization rate $\epsilon_T$ so that:
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{T\to\infty} \Pr\left(\bigcap_{t \in [T] \;:\; |t_0-t| > \epsilon_T}\log\frac{\overline{\pi}_{t_0}}{\overline{\pi}_t} > 2 \log T\right) = 1.
\end{align*}
Thus, with high probability we will have:
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{t \in [T] \;:\; |t_0-t| > \epsilon_T} \overline{\pi}_t < \sum_{t \in [T] \;:\; |t_0-t| > \epsilon_T} \frac{\overline{\pi}_{t_0}}{T^2} \leq \frac{1}{T}.
\end{align*}
So all the mass of $\overline{\boldsymbol{\pi}}_{1:T}$ is concentrating in $\{t \in [T] : |t_0-t| \leq \epsilon_T\}$, meaning that for any $\alpha \in (0,1)$, (\ref{eq:cs}) will only pick coordinates within $\epsilon_T$ of $t_0$ with probability converging to one as as $T\to\infty$. Since $|\{t \in [T] : |t_0-t| \leq \epsilon_T\}| \leq 2\epsilon_T$ this proves the corollary. 

Note that in the argument above we ignored the end-point restrictions we built into the set $\mathcal{T}_\kappa$ in the proofs of Theorems \ref{theorem:smcp}, \ref{theorem:sscp}, and \ref{theorem:smscp}, but if we change the $2 \epsilon_t$ bound to $3 \epsilon_T$, then result still holds since there are at most $\log T$ end points of $[T]$ that could be added to $\mathcal{CS}(\alpha,\overline{\boldsymbol{\pi}}_{1:T})$. For the detection rule, this omission has no effect since $\log^{2+\delta} T$ still dominates $3\epsilon_T$. Proving that the result holds for Theorem \ref{theorem:alpha-mixing} follows an identical argument with the $\log T$ term above replaced by $\log^2 T$.

\end{proof}
